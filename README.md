This repository gives part of codes for "Multiscale-SSIM-based Source-independent Implicit Full Waveform Inversion with a Frequency-controllable Strategy". This work has been submitted toJournal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.

# Overview
This study proposes a source-independent full waveform inversion (FWI) method with a frequency-controllable strategy to overcome the dependence on the accurate source wavelet and retrieve low-frequency components, simultaneously. We proposed to use the multi-scale structural similarity index measure to enhance the structural fitting between predicted and observed seismic data. The proposed method combines implicit neural representation to reduce the nonlinearity of FWI and further mitigate cycle skipping.
